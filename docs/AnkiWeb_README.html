<b>AnkiOCR</b>

Anki 2.1 addon to generate OCR text from images inside of Anki notes/cards. <b>Note that this is only designed for computer generated text, not handwritten.</b>

The aim of this addon was to generate searchable text for image-heavy notes, it is not intended to produce high quality, perfectly ordered text!

Note that because this addon changes the note template, you will see a warning about changing the database and uploading to AnkiWeb. This is normal.

<b> Features </b>
<ul>
    - Convert many notes at once
    - Undo changes very easily
    - Multilanguage support via configuration of detection languages
</ul>

This is currently in beta stage, please submit a bug report on GitHub if bugs are found, or you want to raise a feature request.

<b>Installation</b>

AnkiOCR depends on <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract" rel="nofollow">the Tesseract OCR library</a>.

If you're on <b>Windows</b>, this is included in the addon.
If you're on <b>Mac</b>, the reccomended approach is to install <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a>.
Open terminal and run the command

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

After this, run the command

brew install tesseract

A mac install script is being worked on, but for now use the above instructions.

If you're on <b>Linux</b> <a href="https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html" rel="nofollow"> carefully follow the instructions here</a>

3. After processing, the notes will be updated with an additional 'OCR' field with the extracted text, example below:

4. If you want to remove the OCR field from any notes, select them and then use the "Remove OCR field from selected notes" option in the menu shown above

<b> Known issues</b>
<ul>
    - Will not work with handwritten text, this probably wont change as the library its based on is not optimised for handwritten text
    - Images with differently sized text, and/or images with low resolution text, may not process properly. If you have examples that you think should have been processed, please raise a GitHub issue so I can look into it
</ul>
