<b>AnkiOCR</b>

Anki 2.1 addon to generate OCR text from images inside of Anki notes/cards. Note that this is only designed for computer generated text, not handwritten.

The aim of this addon was to generate searchable text for image-heavy notes, it is not intended to produce high quality, perfectly ordered text!

<b> Features </b>
<ul>
    - Convert many notes at once
    - Undo changes very easily
    - Multilanguage support via configuration of detection languages
</ul>

This is currently in beta stage, please submit a bug report on GitHub if bugs are found, or you want to raise a feature request.

<b>Installation</b>

AnkiOCR depends on <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract" rel="nofollow">the Tesseract OCR library</a>.

This should be installed before going further, <a href="https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html" rel="nofollow"> carefully follow the instructions here</a>
If you're on Windows, I have mirrored the install file, <a href="https://github.com/cfculhane/AnkiOCR/raw/master/deps/win/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20200328.exe" rel="nofollow"> download here</a>

If you install Tesseract to a non-standard location, you may need to update the path to the tesseract executable in the addon config (Tools -&gt; Addons -&gt; Config)
