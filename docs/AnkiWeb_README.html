<b>AnkiOCR</b>

Anki 2.1 addon to generate OCR text from images inside of Anki notes/cards. <b>Note that this is only designed for computer generated text, not handwritten.</b>

The aim of this addon was to generate searchable text for image-heavy notes, it is not intended to produce high quality, perfectly ordered text!

<b> Features </b>
<ul>
    - Convert many notes at once
    - Undo changes very easily
    - Multilanguage support via configuration of detection languages
</ul>

This is currently in beta stage, please submit a bug report on GitHub if bugs are found, or you want to raise a feature request.

<b>Installation</b>

AnkiOCR depends on <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract" rel="nofollow">the Tesseract OCR library</a>.

If you're on <b>Windows</b> or <b>Mac</b>, teseract is bundled with the addon

If you're on <b>Linux</b> <a href="https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html" rel="nofollow"> carefully follow the instructions here</a>

Source code available at <a href="https://github.com/cfculhane/ankiOCR" rel="nofollow"> my GitHub</a>

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.

<b>Usage</b>

1. Open the card browser and select the note(s) you want to process. Use the search bar at the top, select tags, decks, etc.
2. On the toolbar at the top, select 'Cards', then 'AnkiOCR', and select 'Run AnkiOCR on selected notes', as shown below

3. After processing, each of the images in the note will have the ocr data embedded in the `title` html tag, viewable as a tooltip:

4. If you want to remove the OCR data from any notes, select them and then use the "Remove OCR data from selected notes" option in the menu shown above

<b> Known issues</b>
<ul>
    - Will not work with handwritten text, this probably wont change as the library its based on is not optimised for handwritten text
    - Images with differently sized text, and/or images with low resolution text, may not process properly. If you have examples that you think should have been processed, please raise a GitHub issue so I can look into it
    - Note that for versions of anki prior to 2.1.41, the addon is locked to AnkiOCR version 0.5.3, due to breaking changes in the Anki API
</ul>
