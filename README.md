# AnkiOCR
OCR of images in anki cards



## Installation

AnkiOCR depends on [the Tesseract OCR library](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
This should be installed before going further, [install files can be found here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html).

AnkiOCR was built on Python 3.8, but should work for Python versions >= 3.6.

Then clone the git repo:

`git clone https://github.com/cfculhane/AnkiOCR`

Create a venv, then once activated install requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
